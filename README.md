### Description

A program that was *supposed* to be a replica of the popular "stickman" animation program called Pivot (freeware) but open source. I lost interest in this mid-way as it led into my "Photoshop-Like Layers Demo" project, but I present it here for those who want to hack it apart or even (snort) finish it. I admit the code is not one of my best efforts, as it is unfinished, uncommented and probably has many bugs but it may be of some use to someone. uses a mix of VB elements and GDI. No votes nessesary.
